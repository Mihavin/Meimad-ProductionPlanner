# TASKS FOR CODEX

This file is the working task buffer for Codex. Implement the tasks below in the repository. When a task set is completed, this file may be cleared/replaced with the next task set.

## 1. Simplify device identity and update AGENTS.md

Apply the agreed device-identification architecture consistently in documentation, server/client code, configuration, tests, and commissioning tooling.

### Tablet identity
- Tablet identity is **TabletID + MAC address**.
- Do not use tablet authorization tokens, tablet credentials, shared secrets, challenge-response secrets, or equivalent hidden credentials for tablet identity.
- Tablet IP is not a stable identity field.

### CNC machine identity
- CNC machine identity is **MachineID + fixed IP address + MAC address**.
- Do not use `Machine Secret` or equivalent machine credentials for machine identity.

### Important boundary
- Do **not** merge device identity with NC verification or Offset Loader verification/authorization.
- NC verification and Offset Loader verification/authorization remain separate mechanisms and must keep their own workflow semantics.
- Update `AGENTS.md` so future Codex work follows this architecture and does not reintroduce removed tablet/machine credentials.

### Acceptance
- No obsolete tablet token/credential or Machine Secret requirement remains in active architecture/code paths.
- Existing functionality that is unrelated to device identity is preserved.
- Update/add tests for the new identity rules.

## 2. Change CNC verification timeout semantics

The current implementation starts the verification timeout when `OFFSET_LOADER_COMPLETED` creates the verification session. This must change.

### Required state model
Use an explicit verification lifecycle equivalent to:

`ARMED -> PENDING -> SUCCEEDED`

with failure/expiry handling where appropriate.

### Required behavior
1. When the current Offset Loader executes/completes successfully:
   - create/refresh the verification context for the current Production Run / Machine / NC release / Offset Loader release;
   - verification becomes **ARMED**;
   - the response/challenge code may be made available to the tablet;
   - **do not start the 120-second verification timeout yet**.

2. On the **first start of the main NC program** for that armed verification context:
   - verification becomes **PENDING**;
   - set `created_at`/`started_at` as appropriate at this moment;
   - set `expires_at = first_main_nc_start + VerificationTimeoutSeconds`;
   - default timeout remains 120 seconds unless configured otherwise.

3. The operator enters the verification code during this window.

4. After successful verification:
   - state becomes **SUCCEEDED/VERIFIED**;
   - the same released NC program must continue to run without asking for the verification code again on subsequent cycle starts;
   - verification is one-time for that current Offset Loader / NC release context.

5. A newly executed/current Offset Loader must invalidate/reset the previous successful verification and create a new **ARMED** verification context.

6. Expiry must be based on the time since the **first main NC start**, not time since Offset Loader execution.

### Preserve
- Existing stale Offset Loader detection.
- NC identity matching.
- Macro version validation.
- duplicate event handling / idempotency.
- anomaly reporting.
- separation between Offset Loader evidence and NC verification.

### Implementation guidance
Inspect and update at least the relevant server persistence/workflow and Haas ingestion paths, including the current behavior around:
- `CncDprintEventIngestionService`
- `SqliteProductionRunWorkflowEventRepository`
- `SqliteCncVerificationFoundationRepository`
- verification session schema/state handling
- tablet/E-Ink projection of pending verification
- CNC simulator scenarios
- tests and commissioning scripts/configuration where the timeout semantics are assumed.

Do not simply extend the timeout. Change the trigger that starts it.

### Acceptance tests
Add tests that prove:
- Offset Loader completes; wait more than 120 seconds; first NC start still opens a fresh valid 120-second window.
- First NC start starts the timeout.
- Correct verification within the window succeeds.
- Late verification after the window expires is rejected/handled according to the existing failure model.
- After success, second and later NC starts do not require verification again.
- Executing a new Offset Loader resets prior success and requires one new verification.

## 3. Implement fact-driven Tool Room / Setup queue workflow

Use the same queue/view UX pattern already used for QA. Add/complete the corresponding workflow views for Tool Room and Setup without creating a separate standalone application unless the existing architecture requires it.

The guiding rule is: **almost all workflow states are derived automatically from facts/events. Manual actions are only used where a real human handoff must be recorded.**

### A. Queue for Tool Room — automatic
An operation enters **Queue for Tool Room** automatically when all prerequisites required for Tool Room work are present/current, including the released NC package and the required released tool data according to the existing readiness model.

Do not require a manual "send to Tool Room" status button when the facts already make it ready.

### B. Queue for Setup — automatic
When Tool Room finishes its work and uploads/releases the **Tool Offset Table**, the operation automatically leaves Tool Room work and appears in **Queue for Setup**.

No manual status transition should be required for this step.

### C. Handover to setup operator — manual, permissioned
The physical handover of the prepared tool cart from Tool Room to the setup operator is the deliberate manual event.

- Action is performed by **Tool Room Manager** (or the exact existing role that represents that authority; do not broaden it silently).
- Machine is already known from the planner assignment; do not ask the user to reselect it.
- Select/assign the setup operator.
- The setup-operator list must be filtered by the operator's skills/qualification for the assigned machine or machine group.
- Record at minimum operator/user identity and timestamp.
- Transition:
  - `Queue for Setup` -> `Ready for Setup`
- This handover does **not** mean setup has physically started on the CNC yet.

### D. Setup start — automatic from CNC fact
When the assigned/current **Offset Loader is actually started/executed on the CNC**, automatically transition:

`Ready for Setup` -> `Setup In Progress`

This must be driven by machine/Offset Loader telemetry, not a manual `Start Setup` button.

### E. Events and authorization
Separate events into two categories in the domain model/documentation:

**Automatic events** — generated from facts such as release creation, Tool Offset Table release/upload, Offset Loader execution, NC start, verification results, etc.

**Manual events** — only for explicit human actions such as physical Tool Room -> Setup handover/assignment. Every manual event must have an explicit allowed-role/permission rule and must retain actor + timestamp.

### UI
Create/use consistent queue UX for:
- `Queue for QA`
- `Queue for Tool Room`
- `Queue for Setup`

Keep the visual/interaction pattern consistent, but expose only the actions appropriate to each queue.

### Acceptance
- Queue membership can be recomputed from retained facts/events and does not depend on arbitrary manual status toggles.
- Tool Offset Table release automatically produces Queue for Setup eligibility.
- Tool Room handover is auditably manual and permissioned.
- Offset Loader execution automatically starts Setup In Progress.
- Setup operator assignment respects machine skills.
- Add/update tests for transitions, permissions, idempotency, and duplicate telemetry.

## General instructions

- First inspect the current implementation and existing tests before changing architecture.
- Prefer extending the existing event-driven workflow rather than creating parallel state systems.
- Preserve backward-compatible data where practical; add migrations when schema/state changes require them.
- Keep manual workflow authority minimal and explicit.
- Run the full relevant server/client test suites and report the results.
- At completion, summarize changed files, migrations, behavior changes, and any remaining physical-machine commissioning steps.
